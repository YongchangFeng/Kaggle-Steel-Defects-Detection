# Kaggle-Steel-Defects-Detection
An U-net model is build for classification and segmentation of steel defects
Exploratory data analysis shows that training data is highly un-balanced among defect classes and there is no defects on many sample images 
The model is trained with augmentation (on both images and masks)
A few computer vision techniques are used in post-processing to further improve the detection
Dice coefficient of 0.79 is achieved
A few ideas are proposed for future work
